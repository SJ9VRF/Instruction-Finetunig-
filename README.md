# Fine-Tuning Llama 3 for Legal Summarization

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune the Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct model on a legal summarization task. The goal is to adapt this large language model to efficiently summarize legal documents, improving accessibility and comprehension of legal texts.

## Project Overview

The objective of this repository is to showcase the fine-tuning process using a specific dataset that includes pairs of detailed legal texts and their respective concise summaries. This could be particularly useful for legal professionals or anyone interested in automated text summarization in specialized domains.
